# Model Release Checklist

DarkDrive models must not be connected to simulator control until this checklist passes.

Current release status: not approved for simulator control.

## Dataset Quality Gate

- [x] Simulator dataset exists.
- [x] Dataset validation passes.
- [x] Center images found.
- [x] Left images found.
- [x] Right images found.
- [x] Steering labels are numeric.
- [x] Steering distribution has been analyzed.
- [ ] Dataset includes documented recovery driving.
- [ ] Dataset includes documented off-center correction.
- [ ] Near-zero steering concentration is acceptable.
- [ ] Validation split is by session, lap, or track segment.
- [ ] Low-speed parked frames are reviewed or filtered.

## Evaluation Gate

- [x] Offline evaluation script runs.
- [x] MAE is reported.
- [x] RMSE is reported.
- [x] Prediction-vs-actual plot is generated.
- [x] Prediction sample grid is generated.
- [ ] Evaluation includes zero-steering baseline comparison in the official report.
- [ ] Evaluation includes held-out session results.
- [ ] Evaluation includes left/right/curve-specific metrics.
- [ ] Evaluation includes recovery-case metrics.
- [ ] Evaluation has been repeated with at least two random seeds or fixed held-out sessions.

## Prediction Stability Gate

- [ ] Frame-to-frame steering delta is measured.
- [ ] Steering sign flip rate is measured on straight sections.
- [ ] Steering oscillation is reviewed on a validation video sequence.
- [ ] Prediction smoothing is evaluated offline.
- [ ] Smoothing lag is measured on curve entry.
- [ ] No obvious steering oscillation remains.

## Minimum Candidate Thresholds

These are initial research thresholds, not final safety claims.

- MAE should improve by at least 25% over the zero-steering baseline.
- RMSE should improve by at least 30% over the zero-steering baseline.
- Prediction standard deviation should not be severely compressed relative to actual steering.
- Non-zero steering sign accuracy should remain above 90%.
- Sharp-turn and recovery errors should be reviewed separately.

The current model meets the RMSE improvement target but does not meet the MAE improvement target.

## Simulator-Control Gate

Simulator control is blocked until:

- [ ] Dataset quality verified.
- [ ] Evaluation complete.
- [ ] Prediction stability acceptable.
- [ ] No obvious steering oscillation.
- [ ] Release notes identify the exact checkpoint and dataset.
- [ ] The implementation remains simulation-only.

## Current Decision

Do not connect the current model to simulator control.

Blocking issues:

- Dataset is too centered around zero steering.
- Recovery behavior is not documented.
- Validation split is random row-based, not session-based.
- Temporal prediction stability has not been measured.
- Offline MAE only improves 9.95% over the zero-steering baseline.
